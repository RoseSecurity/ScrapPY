ScrapPY is a Python utility for scraping manuals, documents, and other sensitive PDFs to generate wordlists that can be utilized by offensive security tools to perform brute force, forced browsing, and dictionary attacks against targets. The tool dives deep to discover keywords and phrases leading to potential passwords or hidden directories, outputting to a text file that is readable by tools such as Hydra, Dirb, and Nmap. Expedite initial access, vulnerability discovery, and lateral movement with ScrapPY!
